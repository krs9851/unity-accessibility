<p>Learn how to add accessibility features to your unity game. You must have <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html">TextMeshPro</a> installed to use any of the prefabs.

<h1>Visual Accessibility</h1>

<p>This section has two subsections: adjusting text's font and color. These accessibility features are for a variety of different disabilities, including cognitive disabilities and vision disabilities.</p>

<p>Player customization is incredibly important for this section. By having multiple color and font options, you can prioritize the original feel of the game for the majority of players, while still making it accessible.</p>

<p>For font, we recommend having at least three options: original font, sans-serif, and Open Dyslexic. <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/">Open Dyslexic is an open font that is specifically made for people with dyslexia.</a> We also recommend using TextMeshPro assets to help reducing blurry text. <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@4.0/manual/FontAssetsCreator.html">Learn how to make text mesh pro font assets here.</a></p>

<p>For colors, we recommend having four options: original, high-contrast light mode, high-contrast dark mode, and low-contrast mode. Visual disabilities include a wide array of conditions and experiences, so what works for one person with low vision may not work for another one. Low contrast mode can also help people with sensory disabilities, especially those who experience sensory overload.</p>
